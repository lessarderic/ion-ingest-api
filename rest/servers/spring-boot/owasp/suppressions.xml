            [Eric Lessard, 4 July 2019]
            OWASP infers that jackson-databind-nullable 0.1.0 is related to Jackson 0.1.0
            dependencies and flags vulnerabilities on cpe:2.3:a:fasterxml:jackson:0.1.0 and
            cpe:2.3:a:fasterxml:jackson-databind:0.1.0, which do not exist.
            GitHub issue https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/2047 was opened to
            get this vulnerability resolved in OWASP/DependencyCheck itself. This suppression should
            be removed when that issue has been resolved.

            Only present when JDOM 1.x or 2.x jar is in the classpath. JDOM has been excluded in the
            classpath for this project. When the version of jackson-databind has been updated,
            remove this suppression and the maven-enforcer-plugin in pom.xml.
